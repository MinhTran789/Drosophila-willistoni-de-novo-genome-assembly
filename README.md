# Drosophila-willistoni de novo genome assembly
This repository contains the code to implement the de novo assembly step provided by https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16941 on the DNAnexus platform

The author's source code is available at https://github.com/pgonzale60/Nonmodel-Species/blob/main/genome_assembly.sh

The `src/` folder contains the WDL tasks and workflows that need to be compiled to DNAnexus native apps and workflow, using the dxCompiler file
